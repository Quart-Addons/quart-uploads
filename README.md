Quart-Uploads allows your application to flexibly and efficiently handle file
uploading and serving the uploaded files.

You can create different sets of uploads - one for document attachments, one
for photos, etc. - and the application can be configured to save them all in
different places and to generate different URLs for them.

Quart-Uploads is based on `Flask-Uploads <https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads>`_ by maxcountryman.
