File Upload Forms
=================

To actually upload the files, you need to properly set up your form. A form
that uploads files needs to have its method set to POST and its enctype
set to ``multipart/form-data``. If it's set to GET, it won't work at all, and
if you don't set the enctype, only the filename will be transferred.

The field itself should be an ``<input type=file>``.

    <form method=POST enctype=multipart/form-data action="{{ url_for('upload') }}">
        ...
        <input type=file name=photo>
        ...
    </form>
